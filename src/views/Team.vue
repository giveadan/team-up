                <p>Emmanuel Omokaro was born in Benin City, Nigeria and moved to Danbury, Connecticut at the age of eight. He graduated from the University of Connecticut (UConn) with a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Sports Management. At UConn, Emmanuel developed a passion for giving back to the community. As a member of the football team at UConn he would spend his off days volunteering in East Hartford reading to students.  He also volunteered with a non-profit organization called Husky Sports. He later joined the organization as staff member and became the Director for the Teen’s Program and a Graduate Assistant.</p>
                <p>Emmanuel currently works for the corporate social responsibility department at ESPN as the Corporate Citizenship Coordinator. Emmanuel develops and manages local and national volunteer programs for ESPN employees. Emmanuel manages over 500 volunteer events for ESPN. Emmanuel has been with ESPN since 2013.</p>
                <p>Outside of work, Emmanuel continues to give back to the community. He received the 2019 ESPN Volunteer of the Year for all his philanthropic work. Emmanuel helped raise over $40,000 to build a school in Senegal with the buildOn organization and oversaw construction with his fellow Team Up members. He also travelled to Chad with WATER4CHAD to build water pumps so the local community could receive clean water. In Danbury, Connecticut, he founded The Omokaro Family Scholarship fund in 2018 which annually awards scholarships to three college bound students, who are first or second generation college students for the Hord Foundation. While raising money to build a school in Senegal, he had an idea to build an outdoor basketball court. Emmanuel spearheaded the creation of a new outdoor basketball court in memory of his friend Joseph Neumuller who passed away at Saint Gregory the Great School. In 2019, Emmanuel travelled to Guatemala with buildOn again where he helped raise $47,000 to build a school. After returning from the trip to Guatemala, Emmanuel knew he had to start this non-profit to help continue to better the world with the help from the community. </p>
