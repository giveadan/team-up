            <h2>Why Team Up?</h2>
            <p>Team Up aims to create social impact and build capacity while improving communities. Our social impact may vary by community and the specific needs of that community. Our experiences vary from transforming public spaces to providing access to basic human needs such as clean water, recreational space, and education facilities. Team Up believes that when people prosper, communities prosper; that is why one of the key components to making our work sustainable is to engage community members and provide them with the tools and knowledge needed to improve their communities.</p>

            <h2>Where it started</h2>
            <p>Team Up is co-founded by 5 individuals with different backgrounds, but one main common interest, and that is to do good and give back to our communities across the world. We always enjoy talking about how we came together as a team because we believe that fate brought us together. Our current CEO (Emmanuel Omokaro) and CFO (Dima Kasaji) met in high school in 2005, while Emmanuel and our COO (Ramonita Garcia) met in college in 2009. The President of Business Development (Kamal Mohamed) and President of International Development (Adnan Samma) met in college as well in 2013. But it was not until 2017- when all met coincidentally as Dima, Emmanuel and Romanita, were working together to build a primary school in Senegal, while Kamal and Adnan were also fundraising to help their friends build a primary school under the same organization named buildOn. When each of us faced what felt like a dead-end road in our fundraising efforts, we reached out and decided to join forces and work as a team for the same cause. This is when we realized the power of collaborative effort. We worked so well together and were able to build a primary school in Senegal, Africa. We quickly realized that this was the fuel to the fire we had in us to keep going and keep chasing our dream of making the world a better place, something we all are passionate about. At this point – we became a family. In the following couple of years, we worked together to build a primary school in Guatemala, build water pumps in Chad and build a basketball court in Danbury, Connecticut. It was clear how much we enjoy creating social impact and utilizing our different skill sets and collaborative efforts to reach our goals. So – we decided to commit to being part of the change we want to see in this world and established the Team Up organization.
